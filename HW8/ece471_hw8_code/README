3. Describe your something cool: Print the temperature in various units


4. a. Why did we hook up to Vdd? 
	In order to use parasite power, a strong pull-up is required from the
	1-wire line. For our purposes, it makes sense to connect to Vdd. (And
	provide our own pull-up resistor)

   b. i2c, SPI, or 1-wire for 100 yard probe? Why?
	1-wire has the longest reliable range among the three of them, so
	let's use that one!  


5. a. Linux fun - shell scripts (script prints custom message)
