ECE471 HW6 -- Fall 2016

5.	Describe what your "something cool" code does

It does the same as last homework – displays the time in 24-hour format. 

6.Questions 
 a). What does the keyword static mean when you put it in front of C function
definitions?

It means the function is kept local to the file it was declared in. The 
compiler might make it an inline fucntion. 

 b). Does your code in this assignment implement the full i2c protocol? What
is missing? 

No, my code only supports a single device at a specific address (only one
master and slave - full protocol allows multiple). I am unsure if this is code
we need to implement on our end, but this code does not allow for clock 
stretching or arbitration.  

 c). Does your code handle all possible error conditions? List at least 
one error condition your current code would not handle well. 

My code does not handle all possible error conditions. One example is if the
gpio_set_input/output functions failed, it would not be able to handle it 
gracefully. Additionally, if the ACK bit fails, my code would not 
properly handle the error that might be associated with it. 


7.
 a). Using 'cat' – One of the following interupts was listed: 

IPI3:          9         12         11         13  Function call interrupts

 b). Using 'yes' – what's the purpose? 

It seems to simply output "y" and a newline until the program is stopped. It
could be used to immediately send a response to a command that requests one, 
or also be used to test if a system can handle a high load of repeated
operations.
