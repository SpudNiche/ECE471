ECE 471 Fall 2016 -- Homework 4

Name: Nicholas LaJoie 


What you did for something cool (if applicable): LED on when switched was pressed (using
separate pin GPIO 18 to drive LED, GPIO pin 17 to received switch input)  


Answers to Question #5:

a. Why use usleep() instead of a busy loop? Busy loops will usually be optimized away
by the compiler. usleep() is also pretty accurate and built into the system. No need to
figure out how many cycles a busy loop needs. 

b. How does having an operating system make life easy when programming GPIOs? It provides
a layer of abstraction, has documentation that is common across all machines running
that OS, and it doesn't require any special overhead (ie. WiringPi) knowledge. 

c. What limitations does the OS impose that wouldn't be there if we were 
writing directly to hardware? Permissions and security - it makes sure you're not screwing 
anything up bad when trying to write to hardware in some way. 

d. Would you consider a web browser as part of the operating system? Yes, as every system I've
ever used has come with a browser, and it is incredibly useful to immediately access the internet
easily in order to get software and do things on your machine. If it comes with the machine
built in, I would consider it part of the operating system.  

Answers to Question #6:

a. Machine type: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2

b. Kernel version: Linux raspberrypi 4.4.9-v7+ #884 SMP Fri May 6 17:28:59 BST 2016 armv7l GNU/Linux

c. Free Disk space: 23 Gb 

d. The -h option makes the space/size results "human readable" by printing sizes in powers of 1024
