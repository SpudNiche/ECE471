ECE 471 Fall 2016 -- Homework 3

Name: Nicholas LaJoie

Answer to Question #3a: Description of print_number routine – The routine loads
an uninitialized buffer to register r10 and then divides the number to be printed by 10. The
remainder of the division is converted to ASCII by adding 0x30 and 
stored into the buffer memory. The routine continues until each digit of the 
number has been stored in the buffer in the correct order. 1 is added to the
buffer containing the ASCII values, and then printed using the 'print_string'
routine.  

Answer to Question #6:

a. Compare the size of the ARM32 hello_world executable and the THUMB hello_world.thumb
executable - the ARM32 executable is 628 bytes, and the THUMB executable is 600 bytes. 

b. Compare answer to (a) with HW2 - the C executable is 3052 bytes 

c. Which language might you use in a space constrained system? Why? - I would use THUMB in a space
constrained system. The instruction set uses 16-bit commands, reducing file size. However, if I was
considering languages outside of this assignment, THUMB2 is good, and x86 is even better, as it 
uses instructions as small as 1 byte.   

d. Which piece of code was easier/fast to write - C or Assembly? - Writing in C was both easier
and faster for me, personally. This make sense, as C (and most "higher-level" languages) are 
designed to ease the coding process of assembly by making code more readable and understandable
from a higher level perspective. 

Answer to Question #7a: What does 'cal 9 1752' do? - It's not a bug, it displays September of 1752,
which was the year that the British empire adopted the Gregorian calendar, where they had to skip 
11 days ahead, and which is why September 3-13 are missing in the cal command!
