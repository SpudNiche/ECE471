ECE471 Fall 2016 -- HW7

Name: Nicholas LaJoie 

4. Describe your something cool:
Monitor temperature and display the high and low every minute


5. a. Anti-lock brakes – hard, firm, or soft real-time task? Why? (10ms)
	Hard - lives are at risk! 

   b. Tune button – hard, firm or soft real-time task? Why? (1s) 
	Soft - the results are typically useless after deadline, not really high priority. 

   c. Video decoder with 60Hz framerate – hard, firm, or soft real-time task? Why?
	Firm - info is useless if deadline is missed. 

   d. One advantage of SPI over i2c? 
	SPI requires less power, can be faster with full duplex, and i2c can be brought down by one device. 

   e. MCP3008 datasheet – bitbang it? 
	Bit-banging using GPIO with regular Linux is limited in speed – slower than the 10kHz minimum required by SPI.
	(So no, couldn't bit-bang MCP3008 without encountering linearity errors)

6. a. Using /dev/null – nothing happens, it's null! (empty directory/null device)

   b. Using /dev/full - returns that nothing can be written because the device
is full! (Write error, no space left on the device) 

   c. Using /dev/zero – this could be useful if you need to constantly pass
zeros as a command or to program. 

   d. Using /dev/random – I'm assuming it's a device that generates random characters/numbers. 
Could be useful if a program requires random input.
