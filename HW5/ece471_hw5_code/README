6. Describe what your "something cool" code does. 

My something cool displays the time in 24-hour format. 

7.
 a). What part of the Raspberry Pi (hardware) is in charge of the initial 
boot process? Is this normal for an ARM board?

The videocore (GPU) is actually the first component to start the boot
process by loading the first stage from ROM. This reads the bootcode from
the FAT partition on the SD card into the L2 cache (it's RTOS - "ThreadX")
and eventually hands it over to Linux. This is unusual, as most ARM devices
run the first-stage bootloader (usually MLO) and then second-stage (uboot). 

 b). Why is the /boot partition on the Pi a FAT32 filesystem? 

It's simple, low-memory, compatible with most machines, and technically has
no patents on it. Additionally, the boot firmware (burned into the CPU) is
able to easily mount a FAT partition. 

 c). What is the code/program called that is responsible for finishing the 
boot process and loading the operating system? 

start.elf (it initializes a few things, then loads and boots the Linux kernel)

 d). In the i2cdetect output in part 2c you can see that addresses 0-2 and 
0x78-0x7f are not scanned. Why are these addressess skipped?

These addressess are reserved for different purposes (i.e. 1 is the start
byte, 0 is general call address, and others are for future purposes or 
different bus formats).

 a). Using wc – display_final.c has 117 lines 
 b). Using diff – there are 121 lines in the diff file
