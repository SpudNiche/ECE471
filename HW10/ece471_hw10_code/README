ECE471 HW10 -- Fall 2016

  a. Example of bad embedded code: The NASA Mars Climate Rover - ground software was
written using lbf (pounds/foot) unit for force, while the craft was expecting
Newtons for the units. As a result, it got too close to the upper atmosphere of Mars
and disintegrated! 
  b. Why do correct, document, test code that doesn't seem important? Software is often
shared/open-source these days, so you never know if someone will use your code (i.e.
from Github) for something important - they'll trust that you wrote & shared good
code! Also, if you make it a habit now, it'll be easier to get a job as a software
developer.

  a. Changed it to Nov. 9 of 2012
  b. The "Year of 2038" problem - the signed 32-bit integer used to represent time
and date (UTC) will overflow on January 19, 2038 at 3:14:08, therefore, the Linux
system can't and won't represent a time and date beyond that point at the moment! 
  c. Seems like it would be very easy for us to fake the timestamp on our files,
and you wouldn't be able to tell if we've tampered it. We should probably just turn 
our homework in on time...
