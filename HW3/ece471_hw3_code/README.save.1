Answer to Question #3a: Description of print_number routine – The routine loads
an unitialized buffer to register r10 and then divides the number to be printed by 10. The
remainder of the division is converted to ASCII by adding 0x30 and 
stored into the buffer memory. The routine continues until each digit of the 
number has been stored in the buffer in the correct order. 1 is added to the
buffer containing the ASCII values, and then printed using the 'print_string'
routine.  


Answer to Question #6:

a.Compare the size of the ARM32 hello_world executable and the THUMB hello_world.thumb executable. 

b.Compare answer to (a) with HW2

c.Which language might you use in a space constrained system? Why? 

d.Which piece of code was easier/faster to write - C or Assembly? 

Writing in c was both easier and faster for me, personally. This makes sense, as C (and
most "higher-level" languages) are designed to ease the coding process of assembly. 


Answer to Question #7a: What does 'cal 9 1752' do – there is no bug, this command simply prints
the calendar for the specified month and year. In this case, September of 1752 is shown. To 
verify this, I ran 'cal 5 1752' and it displayed May of 1752. (It also didn't hurt to look at 
the 'man cal' page)
